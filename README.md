# SwingPaint
2017/1/10

Hi my name is Rock.

I spend some time to implement my first project Swing Paint.

Thanks to s.saurel's tutorial I am able to finish it.

See line http://www.ssaurel.com/blog/learn-how-to-make-a-swing-painting-and-drawing-application/

Right now the Swing Paint is only able to draw black lines tracking along the mouse

However I will add more functions like color wheel, menu bar, tool bars, brushes.

It is a fun learning expereience, google things online.

I will try to update as soon as possible.
